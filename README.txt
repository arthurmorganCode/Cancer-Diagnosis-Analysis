# Data Mining Project Report

## Introduction

In this project, we performed a comprehensive data mining analysis on a cancer dataset to identify patterns, build predictive models, and gain insights into the data. The dataset contains various features related to cancer diagnosis, and our objective was to explore these features, build a classification model, and perform clustering analysis.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

### Initial Exploration

The dataset was explored to understand its structure, check for missing values, and convert the 'Diagnosis' column to numerical values for further analysis.

### Entropy Calculation

We calculated the entropy for each feature to understand the uncertainty associated with their distributions. Higher entropy indicates more unpredictability.

### Mutual Information

We computed the mutual information between each feature and the target variable ('Diagnosis'). This helps in understanding the dependency between features and the target, which is crucial for feature selection.

### Visualization

The distribution of each feature was plotted to visualize their spread and identify potential outliers.

## Model Building and Evaluation

### Data Splitting and Standardization

The data was split into training and test sets and standardized to ensure that the features have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

### Random Forest Classifier

A Random Forest classifier was trained on the standardized training data. This ensemble learning method combines multiple decision trees to improve classification performance.

### Model Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix was visualized to provide a detailed view of the model's classification performance.

## Clustering Analysis

We performed clustering using KMeans to identify inherent groupings in the data. The clustering results were visualized using pair plots to understand the separation between clusters.

## Correlation Analysis

The Spearman correlation matrix was calculated to understand the relationships between different features. A heatmap was generated to visualize these correlations.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into the cancer dataset. The Random Forest classifier achieved high accuracy, indicating its effectiveness in classifying cancer diagnoses. The clustering analysis revealed meaningful groupings in the data, and the correlation analysis helped understand the relationships between features. These findings demonstrate the power of data mining techniques in extracting valuable information from complex datasets.
